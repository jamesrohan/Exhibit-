Spring 2016 - Assignment #2

Due February 3rd (MW class) and February 4th (TR class), 2016

Note:
For all assignments, always use comments to explain your program.
No copying allowed. If it is found that students copy from each other (in the opinion of the instructor), all  of these programs will get 0.
You must use the names given to name your program. Should you use different names, you would lose 10% of what each program is worth.
 

Objectives:


1.     To gain experience with string objects.

2.     To gain experience with generic algorithms.

3.     To gain experience with files - opening for input and output.

Documentation:
Explain the purpose of the program as detail as possible - 10%.
Develop a solution for the problem and mention algorithms to be used -10%
List data structures to be used in solution. - 5%.
Give a description of how to use the program and expected input/output - 5%
Explain the purpose of each class you develop in the program. - 5%.
Programming:

For each method, give the pre and post conditions and invariant, if any - 10%
Program execution according to the requirements given 45%
Naming of program as required 5%
Print out of source code 5%
Description of program:

You are to write a program name wordcount.java that prompt the user for a user input file name, reads the input words and do the following with those words:

Count the amount of words in the file. A word can end with any of the following: space (single or multiple), an EOLN character or a punctuation mark (which will be part of the word).
Count the amount of lines in the file.
Count the amount of alphanumeric characters in the file.
Count the number of sentences in the file.
Count the amount of vowels in the file - only a, e, i, o, u (lower and upper case) are vowels.
Count the amount of punctuations in the file.
You must output the above information both on the screen as well as an output file name "output.txt".
Here are some requirements for the program:

The program must work even if the input file is empty. If this is the case print a message saying that “the input file is empty” and then terminate the program.


Implementation:
Use as many generic algorithm as possible sothat the size of the program can be reduced.


What to turn in:


1.  The .java and the .class/jar files at the D2L website in the Dropbox folder for A2 no later than 10:00 p.m on the respective due date.

2.     A print out of each of the  .java file (source code) to be given to the TA on the first meeting after the assignment is due.

3.     Make sure that your name is written clearly both on the print out and of course your program.

Spring 2016 - Assignment #2

Due February 3rd (MW class) and February 4th (TR class), 2016

Note:
For all assignments, always use comments to explain your program.
No copying allowed. If it is found that students copy from each other (in the opinion of the instructor), all  of these programs will get 0.
You must use the names given to name your program. Should you use different names, you would lose 10% of what each program is worth.
 

Objectives:


1.     To gain experience with string objects.

2.     To gain experience with generic algorithms.

3.     To gain experience with files - opening for input and output.

Documentation:
Explain the purpose of the program as detail as possible - 10%.
Develop a solution for the problem and mention algorithms to be used -10%
List data structures to be used in solution. - 5%.
Give a description of how to use the program and expected input/output - 5%
Explain the purpose of each class you develop in the program. - 5%.
Programming:

For each method, give the pre and post conditions and invariant, if any - 10%
Program execution according to the requirements given 45%
Naming of program as required 5%
Print out of source code 5%
Description of program:

You are to write a program name wordcount.java that prompt the user for a user input file name, reads the input words and do the following with those words:

Count the amount of words in the file. A word can end with any of the following: space (single or multiple), an EOLN character or a punctuation mark (which will be part of the word).
Count the amount of lines in the file.
Count the amount of alphanumeric characters in the file.
Count the number of sentences in the file.
Count the amount of vowels in the file - only a, e, i, o, u (lower and upper case) are vowels.
Count the amount of punctuations in the file.
You must output the above information both on the screen as well as an output file name "output.txt".
Here are some requirements for the program:

The program must work even if the input file is empty. If this is the case print a message saying that “the input file is empty” and then terminate the program.


Implementation:
Use as many generic algorithm as possible sothat the size of the program can be reduced.


What to turn in:


1.  The .java and the .class/jar files at the D2L website in the Dropbox folder for A2 no later than 10:00 p.m on the respective due date.

2.     A print out of each of the  .java file (source code) to be given to the TA on the first meeting after the assignment is due.

3.     Make sure that your name is written clearly both on the print out and of course your program.
